# fragrance sampling

This is a dash/plotly-dashboard for my fragrance sampling data. When I got into
programming I created a R-Shiny dashboard for this; now I'm learning Python, so
I decided to revisit this project.

In 2018 I wanted to get more into fragrances and read a lot on r/fragrances,
went to local shops for sampling mainstream fragrances and finally decided to
order some more niché samples from [ausliebezumduft.de](https://www.ausliebezumduft.de/).

What started as an attempt to sample a couple fragrances and finding _the one_ developed
into a habit of ordering 5-6 fragrances every month for the next two years.

Looking back this was great experience - being able to wear 200+€ fragrances in
my early 20ies without breaking the bank and smelling truly original ideas from the
best houses! I still didn't buy a full bottle for myself tho..
